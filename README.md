Hello and welcome to my final task code for unix-course. 
From the possible tasks we could have chosen, I decided to do first four (but of course thereÂ´s no need to check all of them to complete the final task).
1. Distribution of PHRED qualities over the whole genome and by chromosome
2. Distribution of read depth (DP) over the whole genome and by chromosome
3. Distribution of PHRED qualities INDELS vs. SNPs
4. Distribution of read depth (DP) qualities INDELS vs. SNPs


**List of files you can find in this repo:**
- dp_filtered.tsv  *only DP values filtered*
- filtered_table.tsv *table used for the 2 to 4th task*
- luscinia_vars.vcf.gz *input file*
- plot1.png *result task 1*
- plot2.png *result task 2*
- plot3.png *result task 3*
- plot4.png *result task 4*
- qual_table3.tsv *table used for the first task, first 6 columns without the header*
- qual_table4.tsv  *first 6 columns with the header*
- snp.tsv  *only SNP/INDEL values filtered*
- workflow.sh  *file with complete workflow in unix*
